# Blessed Are You - பாக்கியவான் நீ

This song of joyful blessing echoes Psalm 32 — “Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.” It celebrates forgiveness, guidance, protection, and freedom from burdens — the Lord teaches, counsels, and guards those who trust Him. In the eternal day, this blessing is perfected — no more sin, only joy in His presence (Revelation 21:4).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, who forgives and blesses,
thank You for covering our sins and guiding our way.
Let us rejoice, lay down every burden, walk in Your truth.
In the eternal day, let us know Your full blessing forever.
Come quickly, our Blessed Redeemer.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
