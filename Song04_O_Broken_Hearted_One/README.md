# O Broken-Hearted One - நொறுங்குண்ட இதயமுள்ளவனே

This song of comfort and restoration echoes Psalm 34 — the Lord is near to the brokenhearted, delivers from all afflictions, turns weeping to joy. It calls us to turn from evil, seek peace, taste and see God’s goodness. In the eternal day, this comfort is perfected — no more sorrow, only joy in His presence (Revelation 21:4).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, who is near to the brokenhearted,
thank You for turning sorrow to joy and affliction to praise.
Heal every crushed spirit, fill with Your peace.
In the eternal day, let us taste Your goodness forever.
Come quickly, our Comforter.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
