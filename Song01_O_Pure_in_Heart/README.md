# O Pure in Heart - பரிசுத்தவான்களே

This song of joyful encouragement echoes Psalm 26 — love the habitation of God’s house, walk in integrity, trust His protection. It calls the pure in heart and waiting remnant to rejoice — the Lord strengthens, hides, and answers. In the eternal day, this encouragement is fulfilled — we dwell in His house, beholding His face forever (Psalm 27:4; Revelation 22:4).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, who calls the pure in heart to see God,
thank You for strengthening waiting hearts.
Let us love Your habitation, walk in integrity, trust Your refuge.
In the eternal day, let us stand in Your presence forever.
Come quickly, our Strength and Joy.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
