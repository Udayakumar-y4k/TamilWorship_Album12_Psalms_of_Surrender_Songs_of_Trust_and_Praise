# My Bones All Declare - என் எலும்புகளெல்லாம் சொல்லும்

This song of bold confidence and divine vindication echoes Psalm 35 — “Contend, O Lord, with those who contend with me… my bones shall say, ‘Lord, who is like You?’” It is a cry for justice, deliverance from enemies, and praise for God’s incomparable nature. In the eternal day, this confidence is perfected — the Lord judges perfectly, and we praise Him as the only true God forever (Revelation 15:3–4).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, incomparable Rock and righteous Judge,
thank You for hearing our cry and contending for us.
Let our bones declare Your uniqueness, our tongues speak Your justice.
In the eternal day, let us praise You without rival.
Come quickly, our incomparable Lord.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
