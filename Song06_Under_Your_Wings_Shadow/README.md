# Under Your Wings' Shadow - உம் செட்டைகளின் நிழலிலே தங்க வருகிறேன்

This song of refuge and contrast echoes Psalm 36 — the wicked have no fear of God, plotting evil, but the Lord’s steadfast love extends to the heavens, and under His wings we find refuge. It is surrender to His protection amid a world without fear of God. In the eternal day, this refuge is perfected — we dwell under His wings forever, drinking from the river of life (Revelation 22:1).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, whose wings shelter us in mercy,
thank You for refuge from the wicked and Your steadfast love.
Let us dwell under Your shadow, fearing You alone.
In the eternal day, let us rest in Your wings forever.
Come quickly, our Refuge.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
