# The Lord Speaks and It Stands - கர்த்தர் சொல்ல ஆகும் அவர் கட்டளையிட நிற்கும்

This majestic song of creation and sovereignty echoes Psalm 33 — by the word of the Lord the heavens were made, His counsel stands forever, the earth is full of His steadfast love. It calls all to fear the Lord and ascribe glory to His name. In the eternal day, this awe is fulfilled — the voice of the Lord thunders like many waters, filling heaven with endless praise (Revelation 19:6).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, whose voice thunders in power and majesty,
thank You for creating and sustaining all by Your word.
Let Your voice shake our hearts into worship.
In the eternal day, let us hear Your voice forever.
Come quickly, Sovereign Lord.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
